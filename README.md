XBOControllerDriver
===================

A Mac OS X kernel extension to support the Xbox One controller.

It's not ready from prime time so the only way to install it at the moment is to build it yourself and load it with kextutil.  I don't recommend this.  At all.  It's a terrible idea.

Since newer versions of OS X require KEXTs to be signed, I'll look into making an installable package in the near future.
